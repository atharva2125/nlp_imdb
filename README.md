# IMDB Sentiment Analysis

This project performs sentiment analysis on movie reviews from the IMDB dataset. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models to classify reviews as positive or negative.

## Project Overview

The project involves the following steps:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** Loading the IMDB dataset, cleaning the text data, and preparing it for machine learning.
2. **Model Training:** Training different machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine) to classify sentiments.
3. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluating the performance of the trained models using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
4. **Sentiment Prediction:** Using the best performing model to predict the sentiment of new movie reviews.

## Usage

To run this project, you'll need the following:

- **Google Colab:** The project is designed to be run in a Google Colab environment.
- **Libraries:** The necessary libraries are imported within the notebook.
- **IMDB Dataset:** The dataset is loaded using the provided path in the notebook.

Simply open the notebook in Google Colab and execute the cells sequentially to perform sentiment analysis.

## Results

The project demonstrates the effectiveness of NLP and machine learning for sentiment analysis. The trained models achieve high accuracy in classifying movie reviews.
